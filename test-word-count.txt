Write a quick and dirty program (Shell, Python, Perl, Java, Lisp,   C++, APL, or whatever) to produce a count of all the different   "words" in a text file.  Use any definition of word that makes   logical sense or makes your job easy.  

what about email address like: afajebe@gmail.com.
what about currencies like: $200
what about hyphenated like: super-mummy
what about special words like: Bo$t0n00
what about special references like: @deji
	The output might look like this:
<welcome home>
129.0.0.256
200%
 - what have we here?
